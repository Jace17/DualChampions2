- The upgrade of the allied champion can be selected after the upgrade of the main champion.
- The default sorting order is changed so the main champion is always first.
- All features are automatically disabled if the "Team Up"" mutator is selected.

# Installation

Install via Thunderstore or manually: copy the mod contents to the 'BepInEx/plugins' folder of your Monster Train 2 installation directory.

# Warning

This is a non-cosmetic mod that changes the game mechanics. Do not use it while playing any online mode as it may cause you to be banned.
